## Information
The HTML and CSS for this page were given to me by the edX bootcamp: Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. My task was to write the JavaScript for this page. The program asks the user a number of questions. If the user answers the question correctly, the score is increased by 1. If the user answers the question incorrectly, the amount of time remaining is reduced by 5 seconds. The program counts the users's score. After the user has finished answering all of the questions, the user is told his/ her final score and can save the score. The user can also view all of the previous scores.
